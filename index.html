    <h2>The Intelligence Tester puts your brain to the test with a series of
      logic based questions. These questions use two numbers to determine a
      solution. On the following pages there are examples as well as one problem
      for you to try. The last page will have your score and display once the
      test is finished.</h2>
   <h3>To begin the Intelligence Tester click the Move On button.</h3>
